### Density-Based Partitioning Methods for Ground-State Molecular Calculations
#### Jonathan Nafziger and Adam Wasserman

With the growing complexity of systems that can be treated with modern
electronic-structure methods, it is critical to develop accurate and efficient strategies to
partition the systems into smaller, more tractable fragments. We review some of the various
recent formalisms that have been proposed to achieve this goal using fragment (ground-state)
electron densities as the main variables, with an emphasis on partition density-functional
theory (PDFT), which the authors have been developing. To expose the subtle but important
differences between alternative approaches and to highlight the challenges involved with
density partitioning, we focus on the simplest possible systems where the various methods can
be transparently compared. We provide benchmark PDFT calculations on homonuclear
diatomic molecules and analyze the associated partition potentials. We derive a new exact
condition determining the strength of the singularities of the partition potentials at the nuclei,
establish the connection between charge-transfer and electronegativity equalization between
fragments, test different ways of dealing with fractional fragment charges and spins, and finally outline a general strategy for
overcoming delocalization and static-correlation errors in density-functional calculations.
